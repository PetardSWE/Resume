    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <hr />
    As a husband and father of two young boys, my free time is somewhat limited.<br />
    However, when I get the chance to spend time with friends or my wife, we often engage in these activities together:
    <ul>
        <li>Watch documentaries on YouTube, primarily focused on cooking, tech, engineering, or nature.</li>
        <li>Coding and learning new things.</li>
        <li>Reading books, particularly in the genres of fantasy, sci-fi, and historical fiction.</li>
        <li>Enjoying board games, tabletop RPGs, and Magic: The Gathering with friends and my wife.</li>
        <li>Playing computer games.</li>
        <li>I love cooking for friends, exploring new recipes, and enhancing my culinary skills.</li>
    </ul>
